## Testing

JavaScript function testing can be found in the [JavaScript Test Results Document](static/docs/FunctionTests.pdf). As most of the logic is handled by Jinja, the JavaScript codebase is very small.
As DRY functions are imported across the entire application - they are tested within the scope they are executed, ie. a enableButton() function is called in reports.js. Testing of this function was carried out within this scope and not where the function is declared

>The following devices / browsers were used by me for testing.

>* Desktop
>   * Firefox 91
>   * Chrome 94
>* Android
>   * Chrome 94
>   * Firefox 91
>* iOS
>   * Safari 15

>I also used [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/) to simulate cross browser Testing

Testing was seperated into 3 categories; user testing, functional testing & performance testing

### USER TESTING

#### UX & Navigation

>* [Dead Link Checker](https://www.deadlinkchecker.com/) was used to check website links

| Success Criteria             | Test Method                                                                |Result  |Comment|Solution|
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |--------|-------|--------|
| Wesbite is easy to navigate | Feedback - Client & Users |   PASS           | The clients wants to revisit some elements of the UI in future developments        |       |

An automated or paid user testing service to be considered for future releases

#### Responsiveness

>* [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/) & [Google Mobile Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly) were previously used for testing, unfortunatley both services were unable to test the site once hosted on Heroku. I could not find a simple solution to this (other than copying and pasting code snippets) - so I tested the site manually across multiple devices & browsers.

### Performance Testing

>* Validation & Performance Testing is documented in the [Validation & Performance Test Results Document](static/docs/Validation.pdf)

The app responds well when opened, however the serving of the pages seems slower than normal. I investigated further and discovered that Heroku does not modify HTTP requests or responses. A third party add-on or a Gzip compression library would need to be used in future releases as Gzipping is considered the single most important performance enhancement for any website / app. As my knowledge of Python / Flask / Django increases I will hopefully be able to improve these minor speed issues and web serving issues. 

Another issue the website encountered is the serving of images in jpeg / png - I ussually webp my images and compress the ones I serve for legacy / less performant browsers. As I am using Cloudinary as a means to store user uploaded images, I will investigate further the use of their AI platform for optimizing and serving images.

Other than the issues listed, the app does work quite well as it stands.
